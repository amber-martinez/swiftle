# Swiftle (WIP)
Swiftle is a word game inspired by The New York Times’ game Wordle with a twist: guess words associated with Taylor Swift. It’s currently a work in progress, but the current features include:
- 6 chances to guess the word using displayed keyboard
- Letters are highlighted on the keyboard and matrix by correct place and correct letter, but not the correct place
- Confetti bursts when correct word is guessed

End features will include progressing through levels to guess different words. As it stands, there is one level.
